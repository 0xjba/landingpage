                <h5 className="text-2xl font-gt text-newblue-900">Our Responsibilities</h5>
                <p className="text-base font-gt  text-newblue-900 tracking-wide">
                Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.
<br></br> <br></br>
Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.</p>

<h5 className="text-2xl font-gt text-newblue-900">Scope</h5>
                <p className="text-base font-gt  text-newblue-900 tracking-wide">
                This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when
an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.
Examples of representing a project or community include using an official
project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting
as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of
a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.</p>

<h5 className="text-2xl font-gt text-newblue-900">Enforcement</h5>
                <p className="text-base font-gt  text-newblue-900 tracking-wide">
                Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at sethu@leapcode.io. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
<br></br><br></br>
Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.</p>
