There are a lot of open-source projects out there, and it's quite tricky to find a perfect one that excites you. On top of that, sometimes you don't understand the code or get nervous about making changes to the code, thinking if it is right or not.    <br /><br />
    We all know this can be a little overwhelming when you are just starting. 
    <br /><br />
But still, we can make it more comfortable and exciting for you to get started. With Leapcode's Open, we are upgrading your experience as a first-time contributor and making it more engaging & straightforward.
    <br /><br />
    A fresh start, the way it should be.
